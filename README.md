A cookiecutter-based template to quickly create a project for a streaming service with standardized project structure.

# Quickstart

pip3 install pipx
```

- Install `cookiecutter` using `pipx` previously installed:
```bash
pipx install cookiecutter
```

- Generate streaming project based on current template:
```bash
pipx run cookiecutter gh:e183b796621afbf902067460/cookiecutter-streaming-template
